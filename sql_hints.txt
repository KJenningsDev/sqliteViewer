HAVING SUM(column2) > 500;

=== JOINING MULTIPLE TABLES ===
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table1 AS a
JOIN table2 AS b ON a.common_key = b.common_key;

SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table1 AS a
LEFT JOIN table2 AS b ON a.common_key = b.common_key;

=== SUBQUERIES ===
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name > (
